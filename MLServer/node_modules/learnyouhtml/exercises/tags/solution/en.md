Now you know how basic HTML document looks like.

Here we need to tell you more about how you can use tags. Tags are case insensitive, so `<br>`, `<BR>`, `<Br>` and `<bR>` works exactly the same. Anyway, we recommend you to write tags in lower case, which is more readable and generally accepted.

If a tag is written with a mistake, then the browser will ignore this tag, so it would look like there is no tag at all.

Note that there is a special kind of tag: comments. Like in any other markup or programming language, sometimes you need to leave a message in your code, so you write comment. In HTML comments are declared using this:

```html
<!-- this is a single-line comment -->

<!--
  this
  is
  a
  multi-line
  comment
-->
```

Use comments to describe specific places in your code. That might be helpful for other developers, including you, to understand this markup in the future.

Okay, let's go back to the `<meta charset="utf-8">`. It doesn't look like a usual tag. What is `charset="utf-8"`? Well, this is an _attribute_ with _value_ and we're going to learn about them in the following exercise.
