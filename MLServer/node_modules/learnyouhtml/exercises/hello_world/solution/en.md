# Here we go!

Okay, you've solved the first exercise. Let's take a look what you wrote in `index.html`. Here is a content:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Hello, world!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    here is a body
  </body>
</html>
```

This is what we call an HTML document. This is a minimal boilerplate for each HTML document.

One of the most important line is the first line:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

That's the <!DOCTYPE> declaration, which represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly. It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).

After the <!DOCTYPE> declaration we have special entities called _tags_, which may have _attributes_ with _values_. We're gonna take a look at this in following exercise.
